Hello,

To check out the current state of the webpage, you can either clone the repo or download the zip. Then move to the project directory and run:
### `$ yarn`
This downloads all of the modules. Then run:
### `$ yarn start`
to run the app in development mode. Then just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. (Although it will most likely open your default web browser.)
